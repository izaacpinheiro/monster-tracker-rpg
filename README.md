# Monster Tracker RPG 🎲
This is a simple project designed to help RPG game masters manage monster health during battle turns.

## Motivation 👏
I've been a big fan of RPGs for over four years now. The worlds and adventures you can explore in these experiences are incredible and have always captivated me. While working on this project, I'm currently playing a Dungeons & Dragons campaign with my cousin and some friends. So I thought—why not build something related to RPGs? That's when the idea came to me: create a tool to help Game Masters organize battles more easily.

## Tools 🛠
I'm currently studying `Java`, which is why I built this entire project using it. Is it the most practical choice? I'm not sure—but it's my choice. I've always enjoyed working with graphical interfaces, so I decided to use `Swing` to build the UI.  
Using `Swing` is simple—but I didn’t realize how _ugly_ it was...

## How it works❔
